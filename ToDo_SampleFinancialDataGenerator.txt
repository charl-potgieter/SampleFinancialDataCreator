Read in opening balance

Roll up a monthly trial balance (factoring in retained earnings account above)
 - I have started this but have incorrectly not factored the opening balance into the balance sheet return values. 
 -  Best approach is to add to journals and buffer.
 - Maybe once coombined group by account and month end--> will make the buffered table a lot smaller and faster to filter.

Create a REAMDE - how do I get this to display on github page?
